# Basic-Networking v1.0

Basic library which implements Client-Server and two P2P technologies, and gives an example GUI on how to use the standalone peer techonlogy
(that means they communicate with no central server)

This is an early version, so bugs can be found pretty easily. Be sure to use this software at your own risk and danger

This was done using the external library ASIO
